/* Generating new releases:
 * - calculate new version
 *   - check last release's latest PR
 *   - count number or PRs (more or less) since then
 *   - add that count to current version (commit count not used since there are a lot and some are useless)
 * - update VGMSTREAM_VERSION "rNNNN" and commit
 *   - may be done directly without PR
 * - create a new release/tag (same name as version, rNNNN), with that commit as a base
 *   - use latest if version change commit was without PR
 * - compile and upload
 *   - on github, after changing version:
 *     - releases > "draft new release" button
 *     - write text and select commit + tag
 *     - publish (even with no binaries) 
 *     - in "actions" tab, workflow should have added a new "rXXXX" compilation
 *     - once done download all binaries there, edit release, upload, save
 * - if version commit was used correctly as release base, "git describe" and plugin
 *   versions should return "rNNNN" without extra text commit number text
